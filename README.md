- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, We're @N0CTRON[XeTute, unable to change @ on git:(].
- ðŸ‘€ We're interested in C/C++ & ASM dev. (DNN, CNN, RNN, UI / UX, Networking, all of it.)
- ðŸŒ± We're currently learning GPU programing.

# Already released: 
- AOS / Array On Steriods: 
A simple alternative to std::vector with only the most used functions, which makes it use less disk space (and maybe is faster? Didn't benchmark.) 

- Memory Management Library / cuMM["CUDA Memory Manager"]: 
A library that provides a custom memory allocator that is optimized for GPU memory allocation and deallocation, etc. This library could be used to manage the memory allocation and deallocation of tensors and other data structures. cuMM supports arrays, by using the "[]" operator overloading.

- VMF / Various Math Functions [CUDA version still in production]:
A library that provides implementations of various activation functions, such as sigmoid, ReLU, and heaviside. This library would be used by the Neural Network Layer Library to provide activation functions for each layer.
